*The supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved.             ------ Victor Hugo*

#### Brief Bio

I'm currently a PhD student at School of Computer Science and Information Systems, where I get onboard at the end of 2020. Previously, I got my master's degree in July 2020 from School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences ([UCAS](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/)). studying at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([ISCAS](http://english.is.cas.cn/)), supervised by [Prof. Beihong Jin](http://work.iscas.ac.cn/index.php/Jinbeihong/index/beihong.html). Prior to ISCAS, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in School of Software, Northeastern University ([NEU](http://english.neu.edu.cn/)) in 2017. More information about me is [here](https://oaimli.github.io/files/CV_MiaoLi.pdf).

My research interests fall in developing machine learning models for natural language processing and text mining. The current research has been focusing on knowledge representation learning, and knowledge-aware natural language processing.
