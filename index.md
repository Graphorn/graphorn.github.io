*The supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved.             ------ Victor Hugo*

#### Brief Bio

I'm currently a third-year master student (exam-exempted postgraduate) at School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences ([UCAS](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/)), now studying at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([ISCAS](http://english.is.cas.cn/)), supervised by [Prof. Beihong Jin](http://work.iscas.ac.cn/index.php/Jinbeihong/index/beihong.html), and  I'm going to graduate in June 2020. Prior to ISCAS, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in School of Software, Northeastern University ([NEU](http://english.neu.edu.cn/)) in 2017. More information about me is [here](https://oaimli.github.io/files/CV_MiaoLi.pdf).

#### Research Interests

My research interests fall in developing machine learning models for natural language processing and text mining. I always desire that machines can understand and generate texts like human beings. 

My current research has been focusing on:

- Deep unsupervised learning for text processing
- Text generation and document-level understanding
- Knowledge guided natural language processing
- Model transparency, interpretability, and controllability
- Deep latent-variable models for text clustering (master thesis) 

#### Technical Skills

- Skilled programming in Python, Java, and LaTeX, also familiar with Linux 
- Proficient in deep learning programming, especially in Keras and Tensorflow, and programming tool boxes (e.g. Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-learn, NLTK)
- Master at most Machine Learning Models (e.g. SVM, LDA, CRF) and inference methods (e.g. Variational Inference and Monte Carlo Method)
- Understand deep learning well, such as CNN, RNN and high-level deep generative models, especially Variational Auto-Encoder
- Familiar with fundamental tasks and models of Natural Language Processing and Text Mining, like text modeling, information extraction, text generation, etc.
