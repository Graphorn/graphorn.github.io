#### Brief Bio

I'm currently a third-year master student (Exam-exempted postgraduate) in Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([ISCAS](http://english.is.cas.cn/)), supervised by [Prof. Beihong Jin](http://work.iscas.ac.cn/index.php/Jinbeihong/index/index), and I'm also affiliated with School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences ([UCAS](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/)). Prior to ISCAS, I obtained my Bachelar's degree in School of Software, Northeastern University ([NEU](http://english.neu.edu.cn/)) in 2017. More information about me is [here](https://oaimli.github.io/files/miaoli-cv.pdf).

#### Research Interests

I am very interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, especially the interaction of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. My current research focuses on:

- Text generation and document-level understanding
- Deep Unsupervised learning and deep generative models for Natural Language Processing
- Knowledge guided Natural Language Processing
- Model transparency, interpretability, and controllability

#### Technical Skills

- Skilled programming in Python, Java, and LaTeX, also familiar with Linux 
- Proficient in deep learning programming, especially in Keras and Tensorflow, and programming tool boxes (e.g. Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-learn, NLTK)
- Master at most Machine Learning Models (e.g. SVM, LDA, CRF) and inference methods (e.g. Variational Inference and Monte Carlo Method)
- Understand deep learning well, such as CNN, RNN and high-level deep generative models, especially Variational Auto-Encoder
- Familiar with fundamental tasks and models of Natural Language Processing, like text modeling, information extraction, text generation, etc.
